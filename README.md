SNAPPVisNG
==========

Update to SNAPP (https://github.com/aneesha/SNAPPVis) using lightweight HTML5 technologies and implemented as a Chrome Extension.

SNAPP extracts data from Moodle forums, and outputs the social network graph. At the moment SNAPP supports Moodle and exports to VNA but lots more to come.
